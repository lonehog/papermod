## Introduction to Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. It's known for its amazing speed and flexibility. In this post, I'll share my experience setting up a Hugo site with the PaperMod theme.

### Why Choose Hugo?

- **Speed**: Hugo builds thousands of pages in milliseconds
- **Flexibility**: Customize your site with themes and shortcodes
- **Simplicity**: Easy installation and minimal dependencies
- **Markdown Support**: Write content in Markdown

### Installing Hugo

To install Hugo on different platforms:

#### Windows
```bash
choco install hugo-extended
```

#### macOS
```bash

```

#### Linux

```

### Setting Up PaperMod Theme

PaperMod is a fast, clean, and responsive Hugo theme. To set it up:

1. Initialize your Hugo site: `hugo new site myblog`
2. Add the PaperMod theme: `git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod`
3. Update your config file to use the theme: `theme = "PaperMod"`

### Customizing Your Site

You can customize the PaperMod theme by adjusting the configuration in your `hugo.toml` file. Some key settings include:

- Changing the site title and description

- Selecting a default theme (light/dark/auto)
- Enabling/disabling features like TOC, reading time, etc.

### Conclusion
